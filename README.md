1. Playfair Cipher Complexity
The Playfair Cipher involves the following steps:

Key Matrix Generation: Constructing a 5×5 matrix from the key takes O(25) ≈ O(1) time.
Text Preprocessing: Formatting the text (removing spaces, replacing 'J' with 'I', and pairing letters) takes O(n) time.
Encryption/Decryption: Each pair of letters is encrypted by searching in the 5×5 matrix:
Searching for a letter in the matrix takes O(1) (since it's a small fixed-size structure).
Each letter pair undergoes a transformation in O(1) time.
Total encryption time is O(n).
Overall Complexity: O(n)

2. Hill Cipher Complexity
The Hill Cipher relies on matrix operations:

Key Matrix Validation: Checking if the matrix is invertible takes O(m³) (using determinant and inverse calculations).
Text-to-Vector Conversion: Converting the text into numeric vectors takes O(n).
Matrix Multiplication: Encrypting a block of m characters using an m×m matrix takes O(m²) time per block.
Decryption: Requires computing the inverse of the key matrix, which is O(m³).
For a text of length n split into blocks of size m:

Encryption takes O((n/m) * m²) = O(nm)
Decryption takes O(m³) + O(nm) ≈ O(m³ + nm)
If m is small (e.g., 2 or 3), Hill Cipher is close to O(n), but matrix inversion adds O(m³) overhead.

3. Vigenère Cipher Complexity
Key Expansion: Repeating or extending the key to match the plaintext length takes O(n).
Encryption/Decryption: Each character is shifted by the corresponding key character in O(1) time.
Overall Complexity: O(n).
Final Comparison
Cipher	Encryption Complexity	Decryption Complexity
Playfair	O(n)	O(n)
Hill	O(nm)	O(m³ + nm)
Vigenère	O(n)	O(n)
Conclusion:

Vigenère and Playfair are efficient (O(n)) since they perform simple character shifts/substitutions.
Hill Cipher is more computationally expensive (O(m³ + nm)) due to matrix operations, especially for large key sizes.
